# Ethereum Network Controls

The objective of the project is to create a service for monitoring the Ethereum network, measuring critical parameters and that verifying the network topology and processing capacity are able to support a fair and balanced market for decentralized exchanges (DEX), based on smart contracts executing on top of the network.

The parameters monitored are the following
1. Network size
2. Transaction processing capacity
3. Gossip propagation 
4. blockchain liveness
